This game takes the player around the world in a small aircraft. You get to explore cities, like New York, San Francisco, Paris, Madrid, London, Frankfurt, and Venice. I am not really sure what the goal is yet

MECHANICS
- Flying to reach the different cities
- Walking to explore the city
- Quests that provide better reasons for visiting each city?
- NPCs you can talk to
- Unique characters, so a base, but each character would have a different outfit or skin texture!

CUSTOM CITY TOOL
I plan on creating a custom tool that would aid in the creation of the cities.
It will have road generation, house generation, foliage generation, and more.
Overall, it will be very complex to create, as there will be many parts to it!
